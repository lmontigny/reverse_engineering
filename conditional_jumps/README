#diff signed/unsigned jump condition
These instructions (JA/JAE/JB/JBE) differ from JG/JGE/JL/JLE in the fact that
they work with unsigned numbers.

# Replace jmp by nop
create .o file: 
    gcc -g -c main.c 
find line to change
    objdump -d -M intel -S main.o | less
change binary code
    vi main.o
    :%!xxd
    //replace 7e0c by 9090 where 90=nop
    :%!xxd -r > new.o
verify: 
    objdump -d -M intel -S new.o | less
compile:
    gcc -o exec new.o
launch
    ./exec
lol
